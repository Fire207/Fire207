## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT Supporter based in Switzerland, passionate about art, technology, and creative problem-solving.

Iâ€™m just getting started on GitHub and excited to build new projects, learn more about coding, and share my journey. I love exploring how technology and creativity intersectâ€”whether Iâ€™m troubleshooting systems or drawing in my sketchbook.

When Iâ€™m not working with tech, youâ€™ll find me enjoying anime (Eyeshield 21 is my all-time favorite!), sketching, or discovering new ways to blend art and IT.

Fun Facts:
- Iâ€™m always up for a good tech challenge.
- Drawing and anime fuel my creativity.
- Iâ€™m eager to connect and collaborate with the GitHub community!

Letâ€™s build and learn together! ðŸš€
